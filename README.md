## üöÄ What I Do

Nexium offers procedural galaxy exploration, dual economies, PvP/PvE combat, guilds, minigames, and seasonal events‚Äîall backed by scalable infrastructure (TypeScript, Node.js, PostgreSQL, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS).

- **Web Applications:**  
  Builder of full-stack apps like [friendly-eureka](https://github.com/Elenyx/friendly-eureka), merging React, Express, and PostgreSQL for MMO-style Discord gaming on both frontend and backend. Focus on real-time updates, robust auth (Discord OAuth2), and modern UI/UX.
